<h2 id="content">Robot Design</h2>
<p>The design for the robot was kind of a tricky one to get right. Looking at other designs, they tried to eliminate as much weight as possible by having lightweight, very basic chassis for the robot, and most had the electronics
for the robot all stuffed inside a very small area of the chassis. There were also some other designs I saw that were the complete opposite, where they had tall chassis for the robot, with the electronics spread out between the
bottom and the top of the robot.</p>

<p>I decided in the end for my design to go in the middle ground. I'd have the robot be a scalable tower type design, with the electronics spread out between the bottom layer and the top layer, with the room to expand the design higher,
if the need arises. I unfortunately was required to have the drivers for the motors attached to the legs of the robot, since the provided cables between the motor and driver were shorter than I was expecting, and thus I had to change
the leg design half way through the project so that the drivers could be mounted to the legs easily.</p>

<h3>Chassis</h3>
<p>As for the Chassis itself, for the prototype, I figured a PLA 3D printed chassis would be good, as it provided enough robustness for prototyping, but was also light enough where the weight of the chassis would not become a concern when
getting the robot to balance itself. I also made the chassis lightweight by having the only solid parts be the base plates and the arms, where strength would be needed, and then the brackets for each layer of the robot was designed to be
strong while having as little amount of material as possible. I had seen other ballbot designs use this kind of bracket design, and I wanted to encorporate it into my design, since it seemed that it would be a strong yet lightweight design.</p>

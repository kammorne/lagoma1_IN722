  <h3>Google Sketchup</h3>
  <p>When it came to designing the robot's chassis, I needed a program to actually both design and export the chassis to a format that I could use
  to 3D print the required parts. For this task, I decided to use Google Sketchup. There are many reasons why I chose this option over other possible
  options that I could have used.</p>
  
  <h4>Reason 1: Prior Experience</h4>
  
  <p>This reason is pretty self-explanatory. I've used Google Sketchup in the past as both a fun little tool to mess around in and design random designs,
  and I've also used Google Sketchup in the past for CAD back in High School. Because of this, I knew my way around the program, so I wouldn't be caught
  up in having to learn a new program when I already had a full platter trying to figure out how to get the robot working in the first place.</p>
  
  <h4>Reason 2: It's Freeware*</h4>
  
  <p>I've included the asterisk in the header for this reason since it's both Freeware and Payware. The most simple version of Sketchup is available online
  for free, which provides enough tools and features to be able to create a basic 3D Model, alongside the ability to export the file into a .stl file which
  is required for the 3D printer software to read to be able to slice the model up into a printable format. However, the Pro version (which I ended up using
  a free trial of) provides a few more tools which I found useful when trying to get the model to fit the requirements I had when designing the chassis.
  I was also more accustomed to the UI of the Pro Version since that was the UI of the free version back when I previously used the software.</p>
  
  <h4>Reason 3: Easy to Use</h4>
  
  <p>With Google Sketchup, I found it rather easy to understand and grasp how to use the software a lot quicker compared to other 3D modelling programs I've tried
  using in the past. I found it's tools and features become easy to use in a matter of minutes, plus the application provides plenty of tutorials and hints for the
  novice user who may need some help understanding how to use the program, whereas other programs I have used in the past require some research and looking about on
  Youtube to find other user-made tutorials regarding the subject, since the program's documentation isn't very clear.</p>

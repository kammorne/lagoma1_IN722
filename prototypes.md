<h2 id="content">Development Process</h2>
  <p>The development process for this whole project was interesting, and also very stressful for me. This was the first time I've taken on some sort of project like this, and really, I just feel like I've been tossed in the deep end. I'll probably have some sort of final thoughts bit lower down. So first off, It was all research, trying to find how others had achieved something like this in the past. After a lot of research and passing multiple different designs which required metal work of sorts, I finally found someone's project where they just 3D Printed the chassis, I figured I could do something similar, and began work on the 3D Models.</p>

  <p>After spending a couple weeks finializing the 3d models, I printed them, did fitting tests, and for most of it, it turned out really well. There were a few parts I had to re-print, and halfway through, I had to re-design then re-print the "arms" of the robot, since I forgot to set up the mounting points for the motors and their drivers, since I wanted to have them on the arms to shorten the wire distance from the motors to the drivers. Even after the re-design for the arms though, I ended up getting the measurements slightly off for the motor mounts, and had to quickly drill the holes out before I could mount them.</p>

  <p>So the Final Prototype didn't really turn out to be much unfortunately. I encountered a lot of troubles and issues throughout the design of this project, and in the end my biggest downfall is just the inexperience with this kind of project. I was really hoping when this project that I wouldn't be left alone with this project, and would have someone else to go through this project with. However, everyone else was interested in their own ideas, and the other team member I had that could help me out with this project disappeared early on.</p>
  
  <p>As the due date came closer for this project, I panicked a lot due to not having running code on the robot, I was having a lot of issues trying to get the code to do anything, since the most I had done beforehand was just a motor test on each of the robot's motor drivers. In desperation, I even looked for similar code that would run on the same board, the ATMega2560, and I was lucky enough to find someone who had done a ballbot project before with the ATMega2560, and even kept everything in a github repository. However, as the final days ticked into hours and then minutes, I could not get it to compile to the robot, giving me the same error code "1" with no help other than it could not compile to the board. In a cry of exhaustion and just plain defeat, I gave up the night before the project was due, with no balancing ball bot to show.</p>

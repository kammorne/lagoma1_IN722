## Hardware

The hardware I'm using for the robot is a simple selection of parts that I found others had used on their projects. Since the whole process of making a self-balancing ball-bot is new to me, I thought I would gather inspiration from
others who had taken on the project before.

The parts I had selected are as follows:

- ATMega Board
- ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver x 3
- 5V Stepper Motor x 3
- 48mm Omni Wheel x 3
- 4 AA Battery Holder
- Batteries
- 3D Printed Chassis

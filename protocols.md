		<p>Over the semester, I have been researching ways to develop Protocols into the ball-bot project. The main reason for wanting to implement protocols for a project such as this is mostly for communication purposes. Having communication from the robot without having a handicap such as a cable connection would be a great way of debugging progress with the robot, and a good way of seeing how the robot reacts to certain environments and conditions it would encounter both during the development phase and during later real-world testing with a larger scale robot.</p>

				<p>Another Protocol I would like to implement, but I don't think I will be able to, is a Bluetooth connection for a Controller. The controller would allow a user to be able to control the robot, which could be expanded further on for a larger scale robot. Eventually, the idea would be to have the robot be autonomous, however during early development stages, having the robot able to balance itself while being controlled by a user would be a major stride in the development. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, along with the skill I currently have regarding building these robots, I don't think I will be able to implement this feature for showcase this year.</p>
